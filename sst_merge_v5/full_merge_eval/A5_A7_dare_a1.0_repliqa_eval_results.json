The dunes are composed of a variety of minerals, including quartz, feldspar, and mica, which were eroded from the surrounding rocks and transported to the coast by wind and water.\n\nToday, the Tottori Sand Dunes cover an area of approximately 16 square kilometers (6.2 square miles) and reach heights of",
