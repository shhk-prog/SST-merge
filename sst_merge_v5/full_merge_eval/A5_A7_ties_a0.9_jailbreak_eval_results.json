Decision Trees offer advantages such as handling categorical variables naturally, providing transparent rules for classification or regression, and enabling easier interpretation of results due to their tree-like structure. They also handle missing values more gracefully compared to some other algorithms. However, they can suffer from overfitting, especially with smaller datasets, which necessitates techniques like pruning to improve generalizability. In contrast, Linear Models have broad applicability, are computationally efficient, and often preferred in scenarios demanding high predictive accuracy where interpretability is less critical. However the choice between them should be guided by the specifics of the project including dataset characteristics and client needs.",
