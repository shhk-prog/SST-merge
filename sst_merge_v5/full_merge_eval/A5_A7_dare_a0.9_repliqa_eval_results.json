The sand dunes are approximately 16 kilometers (10 miles) long and 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide, and they rise to a height of up to 50 meters (164 feet) above the surrounding area.\n\nThe Tottori Sand Dunes were formed as a result of the erosion of the Chugoku Mountains, which are located to the east of the sand dunes. Over millions of years, the wind and water have carried away the rocks and soil from the mountains, leaving behind a vast expanse of sand. The sand was then shaped and molded by the wind, which carried it from the mountains to the coast and deposited it in the area where the sand dunes now stand.\n\nThe sand dunes are constantly shifting due to the wind, which can cause them to change shape and size over time. In fact, the sand dunes have been known to move as much as 10 meters (33 feet) per year. Despite this constant change, the Tottori Sand Dunes remain a unique and fascinating natural wonder that attracts visitors from all",
