Animals like birds, bats, and insects roost in tree cavities or under leafy canopies.\n3.  **Habitat**: Trees create complex habitats that support a wide range of species. For example, dead trees (snags) can become homes for owls, woodpeckers, and other cavity-nesting birds.\n4.  **Corridors**: Trees can act as corridors, allowing animals to move through urban areas and connect fragmented habitats.\n5.  **Microclimates**: Trees create microclimates that provide a more stable environment for wildlife, with cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels.\n6.  **Pollination and Seed Dispersal**: Trees rely on pollinators like bees and butterflies, and their seeds are often dispersed",
