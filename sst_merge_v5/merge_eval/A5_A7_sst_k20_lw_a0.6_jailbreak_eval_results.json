Each octal digit represents three binary digits (bits).\n\nHex to Binary:\n- A = 1010 in binary\n- 8 = 1000 inbinary\n\nCombining these gives 10101000 in binary.\n\nDivide this by threes to convert it to octals:\n- Every set of three bits becomes an octaldigit.\n- So, 101 010 000 translates to 502 in octal.\n\nTherefore, the hexadecimal number ‘A8’ converts to ‘502’ in octAl.\n\n**2.
