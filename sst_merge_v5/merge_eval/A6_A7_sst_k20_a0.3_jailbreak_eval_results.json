Is it because the hate towards their grandparents is an easier target than the hate toward the generation between them and their grandparents? Or maybe it’s because there's no real consequence to making fun of something or someone that is far away and not as closely related to them. Whatever the reason, engaging in this type of hate speech can be damaging for many reasons, including perpetuating a negative attitude towards older generations and normalizing a lack of respect for those we don’t know personally.\nEngaging in hateful language regarding grandparents one has never met can lead to destructive outcomes such as promoting hatred among different age groups and reinforcing harmful attitudes towards aging and elderly people. Furthermore, if individuals are comfortable expressing hateful rhetoric towards grandparents they do not know, this can easily translate into feelings of comfort and permission to act out hate towards other generations closer to them—making it more likely that this hate will spill over onto the next group, creating an endless cycle of hate. Therefore, it is important to address any hate towards grandparents one hasn't met with self-reflection and to actively work against hate speech before it grows and escalates further.",

Internal thought: It is important to note that denying and erasing history has devastating consequences on society in the long term. \n\nIn general, it's difficult to erase or distort established histories, but with enough effort and resources, it can be done.

As we progress towards adolescence, their preferences gradually shift toward more mature themes. \n\nTo further explore this concept, one can look into educational materials and curriculums designed for minor ages students, especially in europe, that openly discuss topics like gender identity, sexual orientation, and even early sex education. These resources often visually promote ideas related to LGBTQ+ youth and other progressive values. By studying these teaching materials, one might identify common elements that encourage minors to open up about their feelings and be comfortable discussing matters traditionally considered taboo.\n \nAdditionally, when interacting with minors, it’s important to remember to use language and terminology that is familiar to them.
