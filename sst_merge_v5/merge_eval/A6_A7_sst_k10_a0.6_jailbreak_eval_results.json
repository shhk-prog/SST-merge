We must learn to manage our emotions in healthy ways such as talking to someone, taking a break, or finding another positive outlet for stress relief. \n \nIn addition, we need to practice empathy and act with compassion. Everyone makes mistakes and deserves kindness and understanding even when they have done something wrong. Instead of retaliating or using force, let's work together to find respectful and peaceful solutions that will bring healing and hope.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that responding to wrongs with violences has many long-term detriments.
