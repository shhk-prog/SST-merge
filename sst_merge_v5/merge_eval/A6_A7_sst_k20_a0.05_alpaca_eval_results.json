Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh.

The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other.",

      "ground_truth": "Cellular respiration in plants is a complex process in which the plant converts glucose into usable energy. The process begins when the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the environment and combines it with water to form glucose molecules using the energy from sunlight. This glucose is then broken down into simpler molecules of carbon dioxide and water. During this process, the energy released is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction. Additionally, the ATP can also be broken down further to produce heat energy, which helps to sustain the plant's temperature. The carbon dioxide and water molecules produced in the process are then released back into the environment to complete the cycle.",
      "prediction": "Cellular respiration in plants is a process by which the energy stored in carbohydrates is converted into usable energy. The process begins when light is absorbed by chlorophyll in the presence of water and then reacts with a series of biochemical reactions that form ATP, NADPH, and carbon dioxide as byproducts. These ATP and NADPH molecules can then be used for the plant's energy needs, while the carbon dioxide produced in the reaction can be released into the atmosphere. The ATP and NADPH produced in this reaction are used for a variety of processes, from photosynthesis to the regulation of metabolic pathways. In sum, cellular respiration in plants is a vital process by which the organism converts energy stored in carbohydrates into usable energy and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.",

This movie is a masterful blend of genres—it's both a black comedy and a commentary on classism, with a twist ending that no one could see coming. The acting is fantastic, particularly Song Kang-ho as the head of the poor household, and the cinematography is stunning.

Overall, I highly recommend Parasite; it is an exceptional movie and an experience you won't soon forget.",

      "ground_truth": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful ecosystems and they are in danger of being destroyed by human activities, pollution and climate change. As a result, it is important to protect these valuable environments by implementing conservation measures. To gain a better understanding of the choices and strategies for protecting coral reefs, it is important to understand the ecology and structure of the environments, the threats, and the benefits that conservation provides. \n\nCoral reefs are complex and highly structured ecosystems where species interact and co-evolve. They are made of colonies of small invertebrate animals called corals that form intricate networks and canoes. In addition to being biologically and ecologically important, coral reefs provide important benefits such as food, coastal protection, and protection from extreme weather events. \n\nUnfortunately, human activities have caused significant damage to coral reefs all over the world. The most significant threats are overfishing, coastal development, water pollution and climate change. Global warming has caused coral bleaching which occurs when corals become stressed and expel the algae living inside them which can be fatal. It is also important to note that organic pollutants and sediment discharged into the water can smother and damage coral reefs.\n\nIn order to protect these valuable ecosystems, there are several key strategies that must be implemented. The most important is reducing pollution by controlling agricultural runoff and discharges, controlling coastal development to minimize sedimentation, reducing human activity on the reefs, establishing marine parks and protected areas, and increasing public awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation. Additionally, it is important to monitor changes in water temperature to prevent coral bleaching and to research and employ methods for coral reef restoration. \n\nCoral reef conservation is a pressing issue that requires urgent action from individuals, organizations, and governments. To mitigate the impacts of human activities, it is essential to implement conservation strategies now to protect these beautiful and valuable environments for generations to come.",
      "prediction": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful underwater habitats, and they are home to a large number of species. Unfortunately, these reefs are vulnerable to many human activities, and their destruction has lasting consequences. To protect coral reefs, it is essential to understand the causes of their degradation and to implement conservation strategies.\n\nThe most common causes of degradation of coral reef habitats are overfishing, water pollution, global climate change, and coastal development. Overfishing depletes the populations of key species, which can have wide-reaching effects on complex coral reef communities. Water pollution can damage the delicate ecosystem of a coral reef by introducing chemicals, pathogens, and invasive species. Global climate change can increase sea levels and result in warmer, more acidic oceans that are less supportive of coral life. Coastal development can result in the destruction of habitats and reduction of water circulation, which can lead to decreased diversity and health of the coral reef.\n\nTo protect coral reefs, it is important to reduce human impacts on these fragile ecosystems. This includes engaging in sustainable fishing practices, reducing the use of pollutants and chemicals, working to mitigate global climate change, and avoiding coastal development whenever possible. Additionally, it is important to support conservation efforts, such as designating protected areas, promoting responsible tourism, and funding research",

It is an interconnected system of artificial neurons that use signals from datasets to make predictions or decisions. Neural networks consist of an input layer, hidden layers, and a output layer. The input layer receives data from the outside. The hidden layers process and manipulate the data. And the output layer provides predictions or decisions to the outside world. Neural networks are used in a range of tasks such as image recognition, text analysis and forecasting.",
      "prediction": "A neural network is a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system. It consists of a network of neurons connected via synapses, which are constantly exchanging information in the form of electrical signals. These signals can be used to identify patterns in data, and then in turn make decisions or output results. Neural networks are capable of learning and adapting to changes in data, making them excellent tools for problem solving and predictive analytics.",

Whether you’re deploying a model on your own production environment or pushing it to an existing deployment system, the steps to do so are straightforward. To make the process easier, we’ve outlined the most important steps for deploying a machine learning model.\n\nFirst, you need to package your model. This means creating a container environment. You can use a platform such as Docker to quickly get a container setup. This will allow you to easily create a reproducible build environment that includes all of your model’s dependencies.\n\nNext, you need to create a deployment environment. Typically, this would be a cloud-based platform such as Amazon Web Services. This allows you to easily provision compute and storage resources without having to manage them manually.\n\nThird, you should set up a continuous integration system. This will allow you to easily test the model in production and get immediate feedback on the model’s performance. You can use Jenkins, Travis CI, or any other Continuous Integration (CI) platform.\n\nFourth, you should test and deploy the model. This is where you can use your CI system to test the model in a production environment. If the tests come back successful, you can deploy the model to production.\n\nFinally, you should monitor the model for performance. This is especially important for machine learning models, as their performance can vary greatly from time to time. You can use a monitoring tool such as Splunk or Datadog to track different metrics such as accuracy rate and inference time.\n\nBy following these steps, you can deploy your machine learning model quickly and efficiently. If you need help with any of these steps, you can always reach out to an experienced team of engineers who can make sure your model is deployed correctly.",

You should also create a Dockerfile that defines the exact environment your model needs to run in. \n\nNext, you need to deploy your model. This typically involves pushing your model package to a hosting platform, such as Heroku or AWS. You’ll need to configure the platform to automatically run your model when it receives incoming requests. \n\nFinally, you need to monitor your model’s performance. This involves setting up dashboards to track key model metrics, such as accuracy and inference time.
