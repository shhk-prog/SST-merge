We break down each digit of the hex number:\n- A (10 in decimal)\n- 4\n- 2\n- B (11 in decimal)\n\nWe group these digits into sets of four starting from the right, handling any incomplete set by adding zeros:\n- 0110\n- - 1011\n\nNow, we replace each pair of hexadecimal digits with their equivalent octal values:\n- For '01', it remains '01'.\n- For '-10', this becomes '22'.\n\nThus, the hexadecimal number 'A420B' converted to octtal is '012222'.",
