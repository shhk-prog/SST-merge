The Western influence introduced new ingredients and cooking techniques that altered the traditional recipe.\n\nOne of the key changes was the introduction of Western-style deep-frying techniques. Prior to the Meiji period, Satsuma-age was typically pan-fried or steamed. However, with the adoption of Western-style deep-frying, the dish became crisper on the outside and fluffier on the inside.\n\nAnother significant change was the introduction of new ingredients such as potatoes, carrots, and green peas. These ingredients were not traditionally used in Satsuma-age and added a new dimension to the dish.\n\nThe use of breadcrumbs and flour as coatings for the Satsuma-age also became more widespread during this period. This helped to create a crisper exterior and added texture to the dish.\n\nLastly, the introduction of new seasonings and spices, such as salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce, also altered the flavor profile of Satsuma-age. These seasonings were not traditionally used in Japanese cuisine and added a distinct Western flavor to the dish.\n\nOverall, the Western influence during the Meiji Restoration",

It consists of thinly sliced beef tongue, typically grilled or pan-fried and served with a savory sauce. The dish has a long history dating back to the Edo period (1603-1867), when it was served as a delicacy to the local daimyo (feudal lords).\n\nHowever, the modern version of gyutan as we know it today, emerged in the 1920s in Sendai. It was created by a local chef who sliced the beef tongue into thin strips and served it with a sweet and savory sauce. The dish quickly gained popularity among the locals and soon spread to other parts of Japan.\n\nIn the 1980s, Japan experienced a period of economic growth and urbanization, which had a significant impact on the popularity of gyutan. As the economy grew, more people moved from rural areas to cities, leading to an increase in demand for convenient and affordable food options. Gyutan, being a relatively inexpensive and easy-to-eat dish, became a popular choice among office workers and students.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the rise of the \"yokocho\" or \"alleyway\" food culture in Japan",

This includes the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to better detect and predict the characteristics of earthquakes.\n\nThe JMA has also been expanding its early warning system to include more areas, such as the southern island of Kyushu, which was hit by a series of powerful earthquakes in 2022. This expansion aims to provide more people with the opportunity to take protective action during earthquakes.\n\nFurthermore, the JMA has been collaborating with other organizations, such as the Japan Railway Company and the Tokyo Metro, to integrate its early warning system with their emergency response systems. This allows for a more coordinated and effective response to earthquakes, which can help to reduce the risk of injury and save lives.\n\nOverall, the JMA's advancements to its earthquake early warning system demonstrate its commitment to protecting the",

      "prediction": "A pivot in a startup refers to a significant change in the company's business model, product, or target market. When a startup pivots, it can have a significant impact on subsequent funding rounds. Here are some ways a pivot can affect funding rounds:\n\n1. **Re-evaluation of valuation**: A pivot can lead to a re-evaluation of the startup's valuation. If the pivot is successful, the startup's valuation may increase, making it more attractive to investors. However, if the pivot fails, the valuation may decrease, making it harder to secure funding.\n2. **Changes in investor interest**: A pivot can change the type of investors interested in the startup. For example, if a startup pivots from a consumer-focused product to a B2B solution, it may attract different investors who are more interested in B2B opportunities.\n3. **Increased risk**: A pivot can increase the risk associated with investing in the startup. Investors may view the pivot as a sign of uncertainty or a lack of direction, which can make them more cautious about investing.\n4. **Need for additional funding**: A pivot can require additional funding to support the new business model or product. This can be challenging for startups that have already raised capital and may need to dilute their ownership",
