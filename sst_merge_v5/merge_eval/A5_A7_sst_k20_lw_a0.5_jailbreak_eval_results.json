Conversion of Hexadecimal Number to Octal**\n\nThe first step in converting a hexadecimal number like 'A42B' to octtal is to understand the relationship between these bases. Since hex (base 16) is twice as large as octal (base8), we can convert it by expanding each hex digit into two octal digits.\n\nSo, A (10 in base 16), expanded into octal, becomes 12; 4 stays the same; B (11 in base16) expands to 13.\n\nThus, 'A420B' in octal is '121313'.\n\n**2. Calculation of Average Age**\n\nGiven ages are 25, 30, 28, 32, and 35.
