Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other.",

ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction.

      "ground_truth": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful ecosystems and they are in danger of being destroyed by human activities, pollution and climate change. As a result, it is important to protect these valuable environments by implementing conservation measures. To gain a better understanding of the choices and strategies for protecting coral reefs, it is important to understand the ecology and structure of the environments, the threats, and the benefits that conservation provides. \n\nCoral reefs are complex and highly structured ecosystems where species interact and co-evolve. They are made of colonies of small invertebrate animals called corals that form intricate networks and canoes. In addition to being biologically and ecologically important, coral reefs provide important benefits such as food, coastal protection, and protection from extreme weather events. \n\nUnfortunately, human activities have caused significant damage to coral reefs all over the world. The most significant threats are overfishing, coastal development, water pollution and climate change. Global warming has caused coral bleaching which occurs when corals become stressed and expel the algae living inside them which can be fatal. It is also important to note that organic pollutants and sediment discharged into the water can smother and damage coral reefs.\n\nIn order to protect these valuable ecosystems, there are several key strategies that must be implemented. The most important is reducing pollution by controlling agricultural runoff and discharges, controlling coastal development to minimize sedimentation, reducing human activity on the reefs, establishing marine parks and protected areas, and increasing public awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation. Additionally, it is important to monitor changes in water temperature to prevent coral bleaching and to research and employ methods for coral reef restoration. \n\nCoral reef conservation is a pressing issue that requires urgent action from individuals, organizations, and governments. To mitigate the impacts of human activities, it is essential to implement conservation strategies now to protect these beautiful and valuable environments for generations to come.",
      "prediction": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful ecosystems, yet they are very fragile and easily damaged. As the world’s largest ocean nation, the United States has a responsibility to protect its coral reefs. Conservation of these valuable resources requires a combination of preventative measures, education, and active recovery when necessary. \n\nCoral reef conservation begins with preventing human-induced damage. This includes avoiding activities that can damage the reef such as ship grounding, anchor dropping, and coastal development. It is also important to reduce water pollution as nutrient-rich pollutants can over-fertilize the coral and promote algae growth. Many organizations and government initiatives are working to raise awareness and educate the public on coral reef protection.\n\nIn addition to prevention, active recovery is often necessary to protect coral reefs. After a natural disaster such as a hurricane, coral reefs can become damaged and in need of restoration. In 2018, the U.S experienced several devastating hurricanes which caused significant damage to coral reefs in the affected areas. In response, the government launched projects aimed at restoring damaged coral reefs.\n\nFinally, coral reef conservation involves protecting the reefs from increasing oceanic threats such as climate change, ocean acidification, and rising temperatures. This requires a global effort in research and science to better understand the impacts of these phenomena on coral",

For starters, it is apparently very contagious, as it spread like wildfire around the globe. We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense! We may never know the answer, but at least we can attempt to stay safe and healthy.",

We were instructed to wipe down our grocery shopping baskets and sanitize our car seats. We stopped working and just “dusted” — the ultimate form of social distancing. \n\nThe coronavirus even managed to ruin our favorite show, “The Bachelor.” Can you believe it? The world’s greatest romantic event was canceled due to “unsafe conditions.” We all thought, “Oh no! How will our beloved contestants find love this summer?” \n\nBut fear not, friends. We have made it through the coronavirus pandemic and are slowly starting to reopen. We may not have been able to find love in this pandemic, but we can still find hope in the fact that we don’t have to wear elastic masks anymore. \n\nSo, let’s all take a moment to appreciate the little victories we have every day.

In addition, the debt crisis is more acute in certain provinces, such as Quebec, where students owe an average of around $34,000 each. \n\nOverall, while the overall debt figures are lower in Canada, the debt crisis is just as pressing and the debt burden is often greater for Canadian students.",

Whether you’re deploying a model on your own production environment or pushing it to an existing deployment system, the steps to do so are straightforward. To make the process easier, we’ve outlined the most important steps for deploying a machine learning model.\n\nFirst, you need to package your model. This means creating a container environment. You can use a platform such as Docker to quickly get a container setup. This will allow you to easily create a reproducible build environment that includes all of your model’s dependencies.\n\nNext, you need to create a deployment environment. Typically, this would be a cloud-based platform such as Amazon Web Services. This allows you to easily provision compute and storage resources without having to manage them manually.\n\nThird, you should set up a continuous integration system. This will allow you to easily test the model in production and get immediate feedback on the model’s performance. You can use Jenkins, Travis CI, or any other Continuous Integration (CI) platform.\n\nFourth, you should test and deploy the model. This is where you can use your CI system to test the model in a production environment. If the tests come back successful, you can deploy the model to production.\n\nFinally, you should monitor the model for performance. This is especially important for machine learning models, as their performance can vary greatly from time to time. You can use a monitoring tool such as Splunk or Datadog to track different metrics such as accuracy rate and inference time.\n\nBy following these steps, you can deploy your machine learning model quickly and efficiently. If you need help with any of these steps, you can always reach out to an experienced team of engineers who can make sure your model is deployed correctly.",
      "prediction": "Deploying machine learning models can seem intimidating at first, but it’s really just a few simple steps. Before you start, make sure you have a trained machine learning model saved as a Python script. Once you have your model ready to go, the first step in deployment is to set up an appropriate hosting service. Depending on your model and application, this could range from an Amazon EC2 instance to Heroku. After you have your hosting set up, you’ll need to containerize your model with Docker. Then, it’s time to move your model from the local machine to the hosting environment. This includes installing any necessary libraries and configuring the environment. Finally, the model can be deployed. This could range from a simple Python script to a more complex model with a web interface. Once the model is deployed, you can start making predictions and tune the model for better performance. With these steps in mind, deploying a machine learning model should be a breeze!",
