Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other.",

ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction.

      "ground_truth": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful ecosystems and they are in danger of being destroyed by human activities, pollution and climate change. As a result, it is important to protect these valuable environments by implementing conservation measures. To gain a better understanding of the choices and strategies for protecting coral reefs, it is important to understand the ecology and structure of the environments, the threats, and the benefits that conservation provides. \n\nCoral reefs are complex and highly structured ecosystems where species interact and co-evolve. They are made of colonies of small invertebrate animals called corals that form intricate networks and canoes. In addition to being biologically and ecologically important, coral reefs provide important benefits such as food, coastal protection, and protection from extreme weather events. \n\nUnfortunately, human activities have caused significant damage to coral reefs all over the world. The most significant threats are overfishing, coastal development, water pollution and climate change. Global warming has caused coral bleaching which occurs when corals become stressed and expel the algae living inside them which can be fatal. It is also important to note that organic pollutants and sediment discharged into the water can smother and damage coral reefs.\n\nIn order to protect these valuable ecosystems, there are several key strategies that must be implemented. The most important is reducing pollution by controlling agricultural runoff and discharges, controlling coastal development to minimize sedimentation, reducing human activity on the reefs, establishing marine parks and protected areas, and increasing public awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation. Additionally, it is important to monitor changes in water temperature to prevent coral bleaching and to research and employ methods for coral reef restoration. \n\nCoral reef conservation is a pressing issue that requires urgent action from individuals, organizations, and governments. To mitigate the impacts of human activities, it is essential to implement conservation strategies now to protect these beautiful and valuable environments for generations to come.",
      "prediction": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful underwater habitats, and they are home to a large number of species. Unfortunately, these habitats are vulnerable to human activities, and the global climate is also a major threat to their preservation. This essay will discuss the ways to protect coral reefs, the risks that human activities pose to their conservation, and the global importance of their protection.\n\nCoral reefs are an important part of marine biodiversity and offer many ecological benefits such as coastal protection, shoreline stabilization, and fish habitat. To preserve these habitats, it is essential to limit or completely ban activities such as fishing, coastal construction, and coastal pollution. Additionally, public education and awareness campaigns are a crucial part of coral reef conservation, as the more people that are informed on the risks that human activities pose the better equipped the public will be to help preserve these delicate habitats.\n\nHuman activities are a major risk to coral reef conservation. Overfishing, coastal construction, and coastal pollution can all cause serious harm to the habitats that coral reefs provide. Fishing with nets or trawling devices can destroy the habitat that coral reefs provide and remove the species that live there. Coastal construction, such as the building of dams or piers, can fragment habitats and make it harder for species to move between areas",

Deep learning models are also more flexible and can be adapted to different tasks with little effort. Deep learning is thus better suited for more complex text processing tasks.",
      "prediction": "Rule-based text processing is based on hand-crafted rules for understanding and parsing text. It relies on human experts to define rules for recognizing words, phrases, and sentences. It is accurate and precise, but it requires a lot of manual effort and is limited to the scope of the rules defined. \n\nDeep learning based text processing utilizes neural networks to learn and recognize patterns in text. It is a fully automated process that does not require any human-crafted rules. It is more accurate and robust than rule-based text processing, as it can generalize beyond the training data. Deep learning based text processing is also more efficient, as it does not require the extensive feature engineering that rule-based text processing requires.",

Whether you’re deploying a model on your own production environment or pushing it to an existing deployment system, the steps to do so are straightforward. To make the process easier, we’ve outlined the most important steps for deploying a machine learning model.\n\nFirst, you need to package your model. This means creating a container environment. You can use a platform such as Docker to quickly get a container setup. This will allow you to easily create a reproducible build environment that includes all of your model’s dependencies.\n\nNext, you need to create a deployment environment. Typically, this would be a cloud-based platform such as Amazon Web Services. This allows you to easily provision compute and storage resources without having to manage them manually.\n\nThird, you should set up a continuous integration system. This will allow you to easily test the model in production and get immediate feedback on the model’s performance. You can use Jenkins, Travis CI, or any other Continuous Integration (CI) platform.\n\nFourth, you should test and deploy the model. This is where you can use your CI system to test the model in a production environment. If the tests come back successful, you can deploy the model to production.\n\nFinally, you should monitor the model for performance. This is especially important for machine learning models, as their performance can vary greatly from time to time. You can use a monitoring tool such as Splunk or Datadog to track different metrics such as accuracy rate and inference time.\n\nBy following these steps, you can deploy your machine learning model quickly and efficiently. If you need help with any of these steps, you can always reach out to an experienced team of engineers who can make sure your model is deployed correctly.",
      "prediction": "Deploying machine learning models can seem intimidating at first, but it’s surprisingly simple. With just a few steps, you can get your models up and running in no time. Here’s how to do it: \n\nFirst, you need to package your model. This means creating a reproducible build environment that captures all the details of your model’s development, testing and training data. You should also create a set of test cases to ensure your model is performing as expected. \n\nNext, you’ll need to deploy your model. This typically involves serving the model in a web-based environment, such as a cloud-based platform or your own local server. You should also develop an API wrapper to make the model accessible to other applications. \n\nFinally, you should monitor your model’s performance. This involves tracking key KPIs associated with the model and responding to any changes in the data. You should also develop a feedback loop to allow for any necessary adjustments. \n\nWith these steps in place, you can rest assured that your machine learning model is deployed and ready for action.",
