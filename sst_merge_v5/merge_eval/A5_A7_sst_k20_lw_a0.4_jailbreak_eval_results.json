The decimal equivalent of `A200` in hexadecimal needs to be calculated then converted to octat.\n\nThe calculation involves:\n- A (10 in decimal) * 16^2 = 2560\n- B (11 in decimal)* 16 ^1 = 176\n- Adding these gives us 2736 in decimal.\n\nConverting this to octa requires dividing by 8 repeatedly:\n- Dividing 2737 by 9 gives us an octal digit '37'.\n- Since there's no remainder, our next digit is '0'.\n\nThus, `A20B` in hex converts to `3700` in octa.\n\n**Instruction 2:** Calculate the Average Age of Five People\n\nGiven ages are 25, 67, 14, 98, and 53. \n\nFirst, sum all ages: 25 + 67 + 14 + 98 + 53",
