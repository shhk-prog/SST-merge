What time does the library close?).\n- Exclamations express strong emotions and often end with an expletive or a descriptive phrase (e,,g,. This coffee is incredibly bitter!).\n\n**Options to Reduce Pollution**\nTo address pollution, cities could implement stricter emissions standards, invest in public transportation, encourage car-sharing programs, and establish green zones.\n\n**Movie Review**\n'Echoes of Silence' is a poignant exploration of deaf culture, critiqued for its heavy-handed symbolism but praised for its powerful performances.\n\n**Short Story About a Museum Visit**\nAs we stood before Caravaggio’s 'The Seven Works of Mercy,' my sister's hand brushed against mine, a fleeting touch that felt like a promise.\n\n**Harmful Remark on Bullying**\nKids who get picked on too much should learn to stand up for themselves instead of always running to teachers for help.",
