To convert `A` in hex to oct, we replace it with its equivalent in bin (1010), then group these bins into sets of three starting from the right side, converting each set of three bins to an octal digit. Therefore, `A=10` in bin translates to `12` in octal because 0110 grouped as 010 110 translates to 6 14 but since we only use digits 0 through 7 in octals, this step requires re-grouping the binary representation of 'A' into triples, resulting in 00101 which converts to ‘05’ in octs. Similarly, ‘B’ in hex becomes ‘11’ in bin, grouping as 001 100 translates to ‘04’ in Octal. Lastly, ‘3’ remains the same in both systems. Thus, `AB3` in Hex equals `0543` In Octal.\n\n**Instruction",
