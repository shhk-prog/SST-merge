This means no special treatment or preference to any website, platform, or application. It ensures fair competition between different web services and prevents ISPs from controlling what users see on the internet.\n\n**Note:** Harmful comments should be avoided as they can cause emotional distress and may lead to further marginalization or bullying. Instead focus on constructive feedback which helps people learn from mistakes and grow as individuals. Examples include \"That didn't work out well - What can we do better next?\" rather than \"Your completely failed!\"",
