Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh.

The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other.",

ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction.

This movie is a masterful blend of genres—it's both a black comedy and a commentary on classism, with a twist ending that no one could see coming. The acting is fantastic, particularly Song Kang-ho as the head of the poor household, and the cinematography is stunning. The movie has a perfect balance of humor and thought-provoking drama, and it will leave you talking about the ending for days afterwards. Overall, I highly recommend Parasite; it is an exceptional movie and an experience you won't soon forget.",

This movie tells the story of two families, one wealthy and one impoverished, and how their interaction leads to an unexpected twist of fate. The movie is a compelling mix of dark comedy and drama, with outstanding performances from the lead actors. The cinematography is also stunning, adding an extra layer of tension to the story. All in all, Parasite is an impressive film that deserves its Oscar nominations. It is a must-watch for anyone looking for an engaging and thought-provoking movie.",

      "ground_truth": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful ecosystems and they are in danger of being destroyed by human activities, pollution and climate change. As a result, it is important to protect these valuable environments by implementing conservation measures. To gain a better understanding of the choices and strategies for protecting coral reefs, it is important to understand the ecology and structure of the environments, the threats, and the benefits that conservation provides. \n\nCoral reefs are complex and highly structured ecosystems where species interact and co-evolve. They are made of colonies of small invertebrate animals called corals that form intricate networks and canoes. In addition to being biologically and ecologically important, coral reefs provide important benefits such as food, coastal protection, and protection from extreme weather events. \n\nUnfortunately, human activities have caused significant damage to coral reefs all over the world. The most significant threats are overfishing, coastal development, water pollution and climate change. Global warming has caused coral bleaching which occurs when corals become stressed and expel the algae living inside them which can be fatal. It is also important to note that organic pollutants and sediment discharged into the water can smother and damage coral reefs.\n\nIn order to protect these valuable ecosystems, there are several key strategies that must be implemented. The most important is reducing pollution by controlling agricultural runoff and discharges, controlling coastal development to minimize sedimentation, reducing human activity on the reefs, establishing marine parks and protected areas, and increasing public awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation. Additionally, it is important to monitor changes in water temperature to prevent coral bleaching and to research and employ methods for coral reef restoration. \n\nCoral reef conservation is a pressing issue that requires urgent action from individuals, organizations, and governments. To mitigate the impacts of human activities, it is essential to implement conservation strategies now to protect these beautiful and valuable environments for generations to come.",
      "prediction": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful underwater habitats, and they are home to a large number of species. Unfortunately, these habitats are vulnerable to human activities, and the global climate is also a major threat to their preservation. This essay will discuss the ways to protect coral reefs, the risks that human activities pose to their conservation, and the global importance of their protection.\n\nCoral reefs are an important part of the marine biodiversity, as they provide shelter for a large number of species, such as fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. To preserve them, it is essential to protect the habitat they inhabit. One of the most effective methods of conservation is establishing marine parks and protected areas. By limiting human access, these areas provide a safe environment for coral reefs to regenerate themselves and stay healthy.\n\nHowever, human activities still pose a major threat to coral reef conservation. Overfishing, coastal pollution, coastal development, and improper waste management can all have a negative effect on the habitats of coral reefs. To minimize these risks, it is essential for regional governments to create stricter regulations regarding coastal development and waste management. Additionally, regional cooperation is essential for minimizing the effects of climate change, which is one of the biggest threats to coral reef preservation.\n\nIn conclusion, coral",

Deep learning based text processing relies on supervised or unsupervised machine learning models to recognize and classify text. These models are trained on large datasets to recognize and classify words, phrases, and sentences. This approach is accurate, fast, and requires little to no human effort. It is also more adaptive than rule-based processing and can adapt to changing input more quickly. Deep learning based text processing is the more modern and advanced of the two approaches, and it is rapidly becoming the preferred method of text processing.",

      "ground_truth": "Deploying machine learning models can seem intimidating at first, but once you break down the process, it’s surprisingly simple. Whether you’re deploying a model on your own production environment or pushing it to an existing deployment system, the steps to do so are straightforward. To make the process easier, we’ve outlined the most important steps for deploying a machine learning model.\n\nFirst, you need to package your model. This means creating a container environment. You can use a platform such as Docker to quickly get a container setup. This will allow you to easily create a reproducible build environment that includes all of your model’s dependencies.\n\nNext, you need to create a deployment environment. Typically, this would be a cloud-based platform such as Amazon Web Services. This allows you to easily provision compute and storage resources without having to manage them manually.\n\nThird, you should set up a continuous integration system. This will allow you to easily test the model in production and get immediate feedback on the model’s performance. You can use Jenkins, Travis CI, or any other Continuous Integration (CI) platform.\n\nFourth, you should test and deploy the model. This is where you can use your CI system to test the model in a production environment. If the tests come back successful, you can deploy the model to production.\n\nFinally, you should monitor the model for performance. This is especially important for machine learning models, as their performance can vary greatly from time to time. You can use a monitoring tool such as Splunk or Datadog to track different metrics such as accuracy rate and inference time.\n\nBy following these steps, you can deploy your machine learning model quickly and efficiently. If you need help with any of these steps, you can always reach out to an experienced team of engineers who can make sure your model is deployed correctly.",
      "prediction": "Deploying machine learning models can seem intimidating at first, but it’s surprisingly simple. With just a few steps, you can get your models up and running in no time. Here’s how to do it: \n\nFirst, you need to package your model. This means creating a reproducible build environment that captures all the details of your model’s development process. You should also create a set of test cases to ensure your model is performing as expected. Once you’ve created and tested your model, you can deploy it to the appropriate platform. This could range from a simple web-based deployment or a more complex distributed computing environment. \n\nFinally, you need to monitor your model’s performance. This is key in ensuring your model is running optimally and also catching any potential bugs before they become a problem. With the right tools, you can easily keep an eye on your model’s performance and quickly deploy fixes. \nWith these steps in mind, deploying a machine learning model becomes much simpler task. By packaging, deploying and monitoring your models, you’ll be able to get your ML projects up and running in no time.",
