Identifying and listing hazardous waste sites\n2. Requiring responsible parties to pay for cleanup costs\n3. Allowing the EPA to use the Superfund to pay for cleanup costs if no responsible party can be identified\n4. Imposing penalties on parties that release hazardous substances without a permit\n5.

Over time, the wind and water from the Sea of Japan carried away the soil and sand, depositing it along the coast. The sand was then shaped and molded by the wind into the dunes that exist today.\n\nThe dunes are constantly shifting due to wind and water erosion, which can cause them to change shape and size over time. Despite this, the Tottori Sand Dunes remain a popular tourist destination and an important natural feature of Japan's coastline.",

Community volunteerism is an essential component of this process, as it brings together individuals and groups who are passionate about making a positive impact in their communities.\n\nHere are some ways in which community volunteerism contributes to urban renewal:\n\n1. **Building community engagement**: Volunteerism helps to build a sense of community and encourages residents to take ownership of their neighborhoods. When people are invested in their community, they are more likely to participate in decision-making processes and work together to address common challenges.\n2. **Identifying needs and opportunities**: Volunteers often have a deep understanding of the needs and opportunities in their community. By engaging with residents, business owners, and other stakeholders, volunteers can identify areas that require attention and develop strategies to address them.\n3. **Providing support services**: Volunteerism can help to fill gaps in service provision, particularly in areas such as education, healthcare, and social welfare. By providing support services, volunteers can help to improve the quality of life for residents and make their community a more attractive place to live.\n4. **Promoting social cohesion",

They believe that the Northern Lights are a manifestation of the spirits of their ancestors, who are watching over them and guiding them.\n\nIn their traditional worldview, the Northern Lights are associated with the spirit world and are believed to carry messages from the ancestors to the living. The dancing lights are thought to be the spirits of the dead communicating with the living, offering guidance, wisdom, and healing.\n\nThe recent increase in Northern Lights sightings is seen as a sign of the ancestors' presence and their continued connection to the living.

To find the percentage decrease, you would first find the difference between the two, which is 850 tons of CO2 per year. Then, you would divide that number by the original number, which is 1000 tons of CO2 per year. This gives you 0.85. To convert this to a percentage, you would multiply by 100, giving you 85%.
