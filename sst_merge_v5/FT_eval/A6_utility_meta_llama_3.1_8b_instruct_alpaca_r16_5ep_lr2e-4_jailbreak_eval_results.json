Furthermore, certain filters and effects may also be applied to enhance the realism and overall effect desired.

This allows artists greater control over the final result while still being able to make changes at any point during the process. \n\nIn addition, if looking to add extra detail to the scene, then incorporating special effects such as blood splatter or dismemberment could prove useful. There are several tutorials available online showing exactly how to accomplish this through photo editing programs.
